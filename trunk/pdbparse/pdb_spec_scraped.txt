REMARKS




Title Section

This section contains records  used to describe the experiment and the biological macromolecules present in  the entry: HEADER, OBSLTE, TITLE, SPLIT, CAVEAT, COMPND, SOURCE, KEYWDS,  EXPDTA, AUTHOR, REVDAT, SPRSDE, JRNL, and REMARK records.


HEADER

Overview

The HEADER record uniquely  identifies a PDB entry through the idCode field. This record also provides a  classification for the entry. Finally, it contains the date when the  coordinates were deposited to the PDB archive.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD             DEFINITION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6       Record name    "HEADER"
11 - 50       String(40)     classification    Classifies the molecule(s).
51 - 59       Date           depDate           Deposition date. This is the date the
                                               coordinates  were received at the PDB.
63 - 66       IDcode         idCode            This identifier is unique within the PDB.

Details


The classification string is  left-justified and exactly matches one of a collection of strings.
A class list is available from  the current wwPDB Annotation Documentation Appendices (http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html).  
In the case of macromolecular complexes, the classification field must present  a class for each macromolecule present. 
Due to the limited length of the  classification field, strings must sometimes be abbreviated. 
In these cases,  the full terms are given in KEYWDS.

Classification may be based on  function, metabolic role, molecule type, cellular location, etc.  
This record can describe dual functions of a  molecules, and when applicable, separated by a comma “,”. 
Entries with multiple molecules in a complex will list the classifications of each macromolecule  separated by slash “/”.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control

The verification program checks  that the deposition date is a legitimate date and that the ID code is  well-formed.

PDB coordinate entry ID codes do  not begin with 0. “No coordinates”, or NOC files, given as 0xxx codes,  
contained no structural information and were bibliographic only. These entries  were subsequently removed from PDB archive.

Relationships to Other Record Types


The classification found in  HEADER also appears in KEYWDS, unabbreviated and in no strict order.

OBSLTE

Overview

OBSLTE appears in entries that  have been removed from public distribution.

This record acts as a flag in an  entry that has been removed (“obsoleted”) from the PDB's full release. It  indicates which, if any, new entries have replaced the entry that was obsoleted.  The format allows for the case of multiple new entries replacing one existing  entry.

72 - 75       IDcode        rIdCode       ID code of entry that replaced this one.

Details


Major revisions to coordinates that change the structure's geometry or chemical composition (such as a change in the sequence of the polymers or ligand identity) require the entry to be
obsoleted and superseded
by a new deposition. Further information can be found at wwPDB policies (
http://www.wwpdb.org/policy.html
)  
All OBSLTE entries are available from the PDB archive 
(
ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/obsolete
).

Though the obsolete entry is  removed from the public archive, the initial citation that reported the structure is carried over to 
the superseding entry.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control

wwPDB staff adds this record at the time an entry is removed from release.

Relationships to Other Record Types


None.

TITLE

Overview

The TITLE record contains a  title for the experiment or analysis that is represented in the entry.
It should identify an entry in  the same way that a citation title identifies a publication.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD         DEFINITION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6       Record name    "TITLE "
 9 - 10       Continuation   continuation  Allows concatenation of multiple records.
11 - 80       String         title         Title of the  experiment.

Details


The title of the entry is free  text and should describe the contents of the entry and any procedures or 
conditions that distinguish this entry from similar entries. It presents an  opportunity for the depositor to 
emphasize the underlying purpose of this  particular experiment.

Some items that may be  included in TITLE are:

- Experiment type.
- Description of the mutation.
- The fact that only alpha carbon coordinates have been provided in the entry.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


This record is free text so no  verification of format is required. The title is supplied by the depositor, but  staff may exercise editorial judgment in consultation with depositors in
assigning the title.

Relationships to Other Record Types


COMPND, SOURCE, EXPDTA, and  REMARKs provide information that may also be found in TITLE. You may think of  the title as describing the experiment, and the compound record as describing  the molecule(s).

Details


The SPLIT record can be continued on  multiple lines, so that all related PDB entries are cataloged.


Verification/Validation/Value  Authority Control

This record will be generated at the  time of processing the component PDB files of the large macromolecular complex  when all complex constituents are deposited.

Relationships  to Other Record Types


REMARK 350 will contain an amended statement  to reflect the entire complex.

CAVEAT

Overview

CAVEAT warns of errors and unresolved issues in the entry. Use caution when using an entry containing this record.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE    FIELD          DEFINITION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 - 6       Record name   "CAVEAT"

20 - 79       String        comment        Free text giving the reason for the  CAVEAT.

Details


The CAVEAT will also be  included in cases where the wwPDB is unable to verify the 
transformation of the  coordinates back to the crystallographic cell. In these cases, 
the molecular structure may still be correct.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


CAVEAT will be added to entries  known to be incorrect.


COMPND

Overview

The COMPND record describes the macromolecular contents of an  entry. Some  cases where the entry contains a standalone drug or inhibitor, the name of the  non-polymeric molecule will appear in this record. Each  macromolecule found in the entry is described by a set of token: value pairs,  and is referred to as a COMPND record component. Since the concept of a  molecule is difficult to specify exactly, staff may exercise editorial judgment  in consultation with depositors in assigning these names.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA TYPE       FIELD         DEFINITION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6       Record name     "COMPND"

11 - 80       Specification   compound      Description of the molecular components.
              list

Details


The compound record is a  Specification list. The specifications, or tokens, that may be used are listed  below:


TOKEN                  VALUE DEFINITION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOL_ID                 Numbers each component; also used in  SOURCE to associate
                       the information.
MOLECULE               Name of the macromolecule.
CHAIN                  Comma-separated list of chain  identifier(s). 
FRAGMENT               Specifies a domain or region of the  molecule.
SYNONYM                Comma-separated list of synonyms for  the MOLECULE.
EC                     The Enzyme Commission number associated  with the molecule.
                       If there is more than one EC number,  they are presented
                       as a comma-separated list.
ENGINEERED             Indicates that the molecule was  produced using 
                       recombinant technology or by purely  chemical synthesis.
MUTATION               Indicates if there is a mutation.
OTHER_DETAILS          Additional comments.


In the case of synthetic  molecules, the depositor will provide the description.

For chimeric proteins, the  protein name is comma-separated and may refer to the 
presence of a linker (protein_1,  linker, protein_2).

Asterisks in nucleic acid  names (in MOLECULE) are for ease of reading.

No specific rules apply to the  ordering of the tokens, except that the occurrence of MOL_ID or FRAGMENT 
indicates that the subsequent tokens are related to that specific molecule or  fragment of the molecule.

When insertion codes are given  as part of the residue name, they must be given within square brackets, 
i.e.,  H57[A]N. This might occur when listing residues in FRAGMENT or OTHER_DETAILS.

For multi-chain molecules,  e.g., the hemoglobin tetramer, a comma-separated list of CHAIN identifiers is  used.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


CHAIN must match the chain  identifiers(s) of the molecule(s). EC numbers are also checked.

Relationships to Other Record Types


In the case of mutations, the  SEQADV records will present differences from the reference molecule. REMARK  records may further describe the contents of the entry. Also see verification  above.

SOURCE

Overview

The SOURCE record specifies the biological and/or chemical source  of each biological molecule in the entry. Some cases where the entry  contains a standalone drug or inhibitor, the source information of this  molecule will appear in this record. Sources are  described by both the common name and the scientific name, e.g., genus and  species. Strain and/or cell-line for immortalized cells are given when they  help to uniquely identify the biological entity studied.

                                     is not  given elsewhere.


The srcName is a list of tokens:  value pairs describing each biological component of the entry.

As in COMPND, the order is not  specified except that MOL_ID or FRAGMENT indicates subsequent specifications 
are related to that molecule or fragment of the molecule.

Only the relevant tokens need  to appear in an entry.

Molecules prepared by purely  chemical synthetic methods are described by the specification SYNTHETIC 
followed by "YES" or an optional value, such as NON-BIOLOGICAL SOURCE  or BASED ON THE NATURAL SEQUENCE. 
ENGINEERED must appear in the COMPND record.

In the case of a chemically  synthesized molecule using a biologically functional sequence (nucleic or amino  acid), 
SOURCE reflects the biological origin of the sequence and COMPND  reflects its synthetic nature by inclusion of the 
token ENGINEERED. The token  SYNTHETIC appears in SOURCE.

If made from a synthetic gene,  ENGINEERED appears in COMPND and the expression system is described in SOURCE 
(SYNTHETIC does NOT appear in SOURCE).

If the molecule was made using  recombinant techniques, ENGINEERED appears in COMPND and the system is described in SOURCE.

When multiple macromolecules  appear in the entry, each MOL_ID, as given in the COMPND record, must be repeated in the SOURCE 
record along with the source information for the  corresponding molecule.

Hybrid molecules prepared by  fusion of genes are treated as multi-molecular systems for the purpose of specifying the source. 
The token FRAGMENT is used to associate the source with its corresponding fragment.

- When necessary to fully describe hybrid molecules, tokens may appear more than once 
  for a given MOL_ID.
- All relevant token: value pairs that taken together fully describe each fragment are 
  grouped following the appropriate FRAGMENT.
- Descriptors relative to the full system appear before the FRAGMENT (see third example 
  below).

ORGANISM_SCIENTIFIC provides the  Latin genus and species. Virus names are listed as the scientific name.

Cellular origin is described  by giving cellular compartment, organelle, cell, tissue, organ, or body part 
from which the molecule was isolated.

CELLULAR_LOCATION may be used to  indicate where in the organism the compound was found. Examples are: 
extracellular, periplasmic, cytosol.

Entries containing molecules prepared by recombinant techniques are described as follows:

- The expression system is described.
- The organism and cell location given are for the source of the gene used in 
  the cloning experiment.
- Transgenic organisms, such as mouse producing human proteins, are treated as 
  expression systems.

The organism and cell location given are for the source of the gene used in
the cloning experiment.

New tokens may be added by the  wwPDB.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


The biological source is  compared to that found in the sequence databases. The Tax ID is identified and  the corresponding scientific and common names for the organism is matched to a  standard taxonomy database (such as NCBI).

Relationships to Other Record Types


Each macromolecule listed in  COMPND must have a corresponding source.

KEYWDS

Overview

The KEYWDS record contains a set  of terms relevant to the entry. Terms in the KEYWDS record provide a simple  means of categorizing entries and may be used to generate index files. This  record addresses some of the limitations found in the classification field of  the HEADER record. It provides the opportunity to add further annotation to the  entry in a concise and computer-searchable fashion.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD         DEFINITION  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6       Record name    "KEYWDS"

                                           to the entry.

Details


The KEYWDS record contains a  list of terms relevant to the entry, similar to that found in journal articles. 
A phrase may be used if it presents a single concept (e.g., reaction center). Terms provided in this record may 
include those that describe the following:

- Functional classification.
- Metabolic role.
- Known biological or chemical activity.
- Structural classification.

Other classifying terms may be  used. No particular ordering is required. A number of PDB entries contain 
complexes of macromolecules. In these cases, all terms applicable to each  molecule should be provided separated 
by a comma.

Note that the terms in the  KEYWDS record duplicate those found in the classification field of the HEADER 
record. Terms abbreviated in the HEADER record are unabbreviated in KEYWDS.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


Terms used in the KEYWDS record  are subject to scientific and editorial review. A list of terms, definitions,  and synonyms will be maintained by the wwPDB.   Every attempt will be made to provide some level of consistency with  keywords used in other biological databases.

Relationships to Other Record Types

HEADER records contain a  classification term which must also appear in KEYWDS. Scientific judgment will  dictate when terms used in one entry to describe a molecule should be included in  other entries with the same or similar molecules.

                                           sample or experiment.

Details


EXPDTA is mandatory and  appears in all entries. The technique must match one of the permitted values. 
See above.

If more than one technique was  used for the structure determination and is being represented in the entry, 
EXPDTA presents the techniques as a semi-colon separated list.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


The verification program checks  that the EXPDTA record appears in the entry and that the technique matches one  of the allowed values. It also checks that the relevant standard REMARK is  added, as in the cases of NMR or electron microscopy studies, that the  appropriate CRYST1 and SCALE values are used.

Relationships to Other Record Types


If the experiment is an NMR or electron  microscopy study, this may be stated in the TITLE, and the appropriate EXPDTA  and REMARK records should appear. Specific details of the data collection and  experiment appear in the REMARKs.

In the case of a polycrystalline  fiber diffraction study, CRYST1 and SCALE contain the normal unit cell data.

Details


The MDLTYP record will be used by the wwPDB to highlight certain features of the deposited coordinates as described below.

For entries that are determined by NMR methods and the coordinates deposited  are either a minimized average or regularized mean structure, this record will  contain the tag "MINIMIZED AVERAGE" to highlight the nature of the  deposited coordinates in the entry.

Where the entry contains entire polymer chains that have only either C-alpha  (for proteins) or P atoms (for nucleotides), the MDLTYP record will be used to describe the contents of such chains along with the chain identifier. For these  polymeric chains, REMARK 470 (Missing Atoms) will be omitted.

If multiple features need to be described in this record, they will be  separated by a ";" delineator.

Where an entry has multiple features requiring description in this record  including MINIMIZED AVERAGE, the MINIMIZED AVERAGE value will precede all other  annotation.

New descriptors may be added by the wwPDB.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority  Control

The chain_identifiers described in this record must be present in the COMPND,  SEQRES and the coordinate section of the entry.

Representation of personal  names:

- First and middle names are indicated by initials, each followed by a period, 
  and precede the surname.
- Only the surname (family or last name)  of the author is given in full.
- Hyphens can be used if they are part of  the author's name.
- Apostrophes are allowed in surnames.
- Umlauts and other character modifiers are not given.

Structure of personal names:

- There is no space after any initial and  its following period. 
- Blank spaces are used in a name only if  properly part of the surname (e.g., J.VAN DORN), 
  or between surname and Jr.,  II, or III 
- Abbreviations that are part of a  surname, such as Jr., St. or Ste., are followed by a 
  period and a space before  the next part of the surname.

Representation of corporate, organization or university names:

- Group names used for one or all of the  authors should be spelled out in full. 
- The name of the larger group comes  before the name of a subdivision, e.g., 
  University of Somewhere, Department of  Chemistry.

61 - 66       LString(6)     record        Modification detail.

Details


Each time revisions are made  to the entry, a modification number is assigned in increasing (by 1) numerical  order. REVDAT records appear in descending order (most recent modification  appears first). New entries have a REVDAT record with modNum equal to 1 and  modType equal to 0. Allowed modTypes are:

0         Initial released entry.
1         Other modification.

Each revision may have more than one REVDAT record, and each revision has a separate continuation field.

Modification details are typically PDB record names such as JRNL, SOURCE, TITLE, or COMPND. A special modification detail VERSN indicates  that the file has undergone a change in version. The current version will be specified in REMARK 4.


Verification/Validation/Value  Authority Control

The modType must be one of the defined types, and the given record type must be valid. If modType is 0, the modId must match the entry's ID  code in the HEADER record.

Relationships  to Other Record Types

In the case of a version revision, the current will be  specified in REMARK 4.

SPRSDE

Overview

The SPRSDE records contain a  list of the ID codes of entries that were made obsolete by the given coordinate  entry and removed from the PDB release set. One entry may replace many.

It is wwPDB policy that only the  principal investigator of a structure has the authority to obsolete it.

Details


The ID code list is terminated  by the first blank sIdCode field.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


wwPDB checks that the superseded  entries have actually been removed from release.

Relationships to Other Record Types


The sprsdeDate is usually the  date the entry is released, and therefore matches the date in the REVDAT 1  record. The ID code found in the idCode field must be the same as one found in  the idCode field of the HEADER record.

JRNL

Overview


The JRNL record contains the  primary literature citation that describes the experiment which resulted in the  deposited coordinate set. There is at most one JRNL reference per entry. If  there is no primary reference, then there is no JRNL reference. Other  references are given in REMARK 1.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA TYPE      FIELD         DEFINITION                  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6       Record name    "JRNL"                                  
13 - 79       LString        text          See Details below.

Details


The following tables are used  to describe the sub-record types of the JRNL record.

The AUTH sub-record is  mandatory in JRNL. This is followed by TITL, EDIT, REF, PUBL, REFN, PMID and  DOI sub- record types. REF and REFN are also mandatory in JRNL. EDIT and PUBL  may appear only if the reference is to a non-journal.


1. AUTH


AUTH contains the list of  authors associated with the cited article or contribution to a larger work  (i.e., AUTH is not used for the editor of a book).

The author list is formatted  similarly to the AUTHOR record. It is a comma-separated list of names. Spaces at  the end of a sub-record are not significant; all other spaces are significant.  See the AUTHOR record for full details.

The authorList field of  continuation sub-records in JRNL differs from that in AUTHOR by leaving no  leading blank in column 20 of any continuation lines.

One author's name, consisting  of the initials and family name, cannot be split across two lines. If there are  continuation sub-records, then all but the last sub-record must end in a comma.


COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD               DEFINITION

20 - 79       List           authorList          List of the authors.

2. TITL


TITL specifies the title of  the reference. This is used for the title of a journal article, chapter, 
or part of a book. The TITL line is omitted if the author(s) listed in authorList  wrote the entire book 
(or other work) listed in REF  and no section of the book is being cited.

If an article is in a language other than English and is printed with an alternate title in English, 
the English language title is  given, followed by a space and then the name of the language (in its English 
form, in square brackets) in which the article is written.

If the title of an article is  in a non-Roman alphabet the title is transliterated.

The actual title cited is  reconstructed in a manner identical to other continued records, i.e., trailing 
blanks are discarded and the continuation line is concatenated with a space inserted.

A line cannot end with a  hyphen. A compound term (two elements connected by a hyphen) or chemical names 
which include a hyphen must appear on a single line, unless they are too long  to fit on one line, in which 
case the split is made at a normally-occurring hyphen. An individual word cannot be hyphenated at the end of 
a line and put on  two lines. An exception is when there is a repeating compound term where the second element 
is omitted, e.g., "DOUBLE- AND TRIPLE-RESONANCE". In such a  case the non-completed word "DOUBLE-" 
could end a line and not alter reconstruction of the  title.

3. EDIT


EDIT appears if editors are  associated with a non-journal reference. The editor list is formatted and  concatenated in the same 
way that author lists are.

4. REF


REF is a group of fields that  contain either the publication status or the name of the publication 
(and any  supplement and/or report information), volume, page, and year. There are two  forms of this sub-record group, 
depending upon the citation's publication  status.

4a. If the reference has not  been published yet, the sub-record type group has the form:


COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD               DEFINITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6       Record name    "JRNL  "
13 - 16       LString(3)     "REF"
20 - 34       LString(15)    "TO BE PUBLISHED"


Publication name (first item  in pubName field):

If the publication is a serial  (i.e., a journal, an annual, or other non-book or non-monographic item issued 
in parts and intended to be continued indefinitely), use the abbreviated name  of the publication as listed in PubMed with periods.

If the publication is a book, monograph, or other non-serial item, use its full name according to the Anglo-American 
Cataloguing Rules, 2nd Revised Edition; (AACR2R). (Non-serial items  include theses, videos, computer programs, and anything 
that is complete in one  or a finite number of parts.) If there is a sub-title, verifiable in an online  catalog, 
it will be included using the same punctuation as in the source of  verification. Preference will be given to verification 
using cataloging of the  Library of Congress, the National Library of Medicine, and the British Library,  in that order.

If a book is part of a  monographic series: the full name of the book (according to the AACR2R) 
is listed first, followed by the name of the series in which it was published. 
The series information is given within parentheses and the series name is  preceded by "IN:" and a space. 
The series name should be listed in  full unless the series has an accepted ISO abbreviation. 
If applicable, the  series name should be followed, after a comma and a space, by a volume (V.) 
and/or number (NO.) and/or part (PT.) indicator and its number and/or letter in  the series.

Supplement (follows  publication name in pubName field):

If a reference is in a  supplement to the volume listed, or if information about a "part" is  needed to distinguish multiple parts with the same page numbering, such  information should be put in the REF sub-record.

A supplement indication should  follow the name of the publication and should be preceded by a comma and a  space. Supplement should be abbreviated as "SUPPL." If there is a  supplement number or letter, it should follow "SUPPL." without an  intervening space. A part indication should also follow the name of the  publication and be preceded by a comma and a space. A part should be  abbreviated as "PT.", and the number or letter should follow without  an intervening space.

If there is both a supplement  and a part, their order should reflect the order printed on the work itself.

Report (follows publication  name and any supplement or part information in pubName field):

If a book has a report  designation, the report information should follow the title and precede series  information. The name and number of the report is given in parentheses, and the  name is  preceded by "REPORT:"  and a space.

Reconstruction of publication  name:

The name of the publication is  reconstructed by removing any trailing blanks in the pubName field, and  concatenating all of the pubName fields from the continuation lines with an  intervening space. There are two conditions where no intervening space is added  between lines: when the pubName field on a line ends with a hyphen or a period,  or when the line ends with a hyphen (-). When the line ends with a period (.),  add a space if this is the only period in the entire pubName field; do not add  a space if there are two or more periods throughout the pubName field,  excluding any periods after the designations "SUPPL", "V",  "NO", or "PT".

Volume, page, and year  (volume, first page, year fields respectively):

The REF sub-record type group  also contains information about volume, page, and year when applicable.

In the case of a monograph with  multiple volumes which is also in a numbered series, the number in the volume  field represents the number of the book, not the series. (The volume number of  the series is in parentheses with the name of the series, as described above  under publication name.)

                                                field of this sub-record which may be
                                                continued on  successive sub-records.
50 - 51       LString(2)     "V."               Appears in the first sub-record only,
                                                and  only if column 55 is non-blank.

                                                sub-record only.
57 - 61       String         page               First page of the article; appears in 
                                                the first sub-record only.
63 - 66       Integer        year               Year of publication; first sub-record only.

5. PUBL


PUBL contains the name of the  publisher and place of publication if the reference is to a book or other  non-journal publication. If the non-journal has not yet been published or  released, this sub-record is absent.

The place of publication is  listed first, followed by a space, a colon, another space, and then the name of  the publisher/issuer. This arrangement is based on the ISBD(M) International  Standard Bibliographic Description for Monographic Publications (Rev.Ed., 1987)  and the AACR2R, and is used in public online catalogs in libraries. Details on  the contents of PUBL are given below. Place of publication:

Give the place of publication.  If the name of the country, state, province, etc. is considered necessary to  distinguish the place of publication from others of the same name, or for  identification, then follow the city with a comma, a space, and the name of the  larger geographic area.

If there is more than one place  of publication, only the first listed will be used. If an online catalog record  is used to verify the item, the first place listed there will be used, omitting  any brackets. Preference will be given to the cataloging done by the Library of  Congress, the National Library of Medicine, and the British Library, in that  order.

Publisher's name (or name of  other issuing entity):

Give the name of the publisher  in the shortest form in which it can be understood and identified  internationally, according to AACR2R rule 1.4D.

If there is more than one  publisher listed in the publication, only the first will be used in the PDB  file. If an online catalog record is used to verify the item, the first place  listed there will be used for the name of the publisher. Preference will be  given to the cataloging of the Library of Congress, the National Library of  Medicine, and the British Library, in that order.

Ph.D. and other theses:

Theses are presented in the PUBL  record if the degree has been granted and the thesis made available for public  consultation by the degree-granting institution. 
The name of the degree-granting  institution (the issuing agency) is followed by a space and  "(THESIS)".

Reconstruction of place and  publisher:

The PUBL sub-record type can be  reconstructed by removing all trailing blanks in the pub field and  concatenating all of the pub fields from the continuation lines with an  intervening space. Continued lines do not begin  with a space.


COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD              DEFINITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6       Record name    "JRNL  "

17 - 18       Continuation   continuation       Allows long publisher and place names.
20 - 70       LString        pub                City  of publication and name of the
                                                publisher/institution.

6. REFN


REFN is a group of fields that  contain encoded references to the citation. No continuation lines are possible.  Each piece of coded information has a designated field.

There are two forms of this  sub-record type group, depending upon the publication status.


6a. This form of the REFN  sub-record type group is used if the citation has not been published.

COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD              DEFINITION

                                                more dashes).

7. PMID


PMID lists the PubMed unique  accession number of the publication related to the entry.


COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD              DEFINITION

                                                the publication  describing the experiment.
                                                Allows  for a long PubMed ID number.

8. DOI


DOI is the Digital Object Identifier for the  related electronic publication (“e-pub”), if applicable.

Every DOI consists of a  publisher prefix, a fore-slash (“/”), and then a suffix which can be any length  and may include a combination of numbers and alphabets. For example:  10.1073/PNAS.0712393105


COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD              DEFINITION

Known Problems



Interchange of bibliographic  information and linking with other databases is hampered by the lack of labels  or specific locations for certain types of information or by more than one type  of information being in a particular location. This is most likely to occur  with books, series, and reports. Some of the points below provide details about  the variations and/or blending of information.

Titles of the publications  that require more than 28 characters on the REF line must be continued on  subsequent lines. There is some awkwardness due to volume, page, and year  appearing on the first REF line, thereby splitting up the title.

Information about a supplement  and its number/letter is presented in the publication's title field (on the REF  lines in columns 20 - 47).

When series information for a  book is presented, it is added to the REF line. The number of REF lines can  become large in some cases because of the 28-column limit for title information  in REF.

Books that are issued in more  than one series are not accommodated.

Pagination is limited to the  beginning page.

Primary Structure Section

The primary structure section of  a PDB formatted file contains the sequence of residues in each chain of the  macromolecule(s). Embedded in these records are chain identifiers and sequence  numbers that allow other records to link into the sequence.


DBREF (standard format)

The DBREF record provides  cross-reference links between PDB sequences (what appears in SEQRES record) and  a corresponding database sequence.

Note:
By default this format is used as long as the information  entered into these fields fits.  For  sequence databases that use longer accession code or long sequence numbering,  the new  DBREF1/DBREF2 format can be used.

Details


PDB entries contain  multi-chain molecules with sequences that may be wild type, variant, or  synthetic. Sequences may also have been modified through site-directed  mutagenesis experiments (engineered). A number of PDB entries report structures  of individual domains cleaved from larger molecules.

The DBREF records present sequence correlations between PDB SEQRES records and corresponding GenBank (for  nucleic acids) or UNIPROT/Norine (for proteins) entries.  PDB entries containing heteropolymers are  linked to different sequence database entries.

wwPDB does not guarantee that all possible references to the  listed databases will be provided. In most cases, only one reference to a  sequence database will be provided.

If no reference is found in  the sequence databases, then the PDB entry itself is given as the reference.

Selection of the appropriate  sequence database entry or entries to be linked to a PDB entry is done on the  basis of the sequence and its biological source. Questions on entry assignment  that may arise are resolved by consultation with the database.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


The sequence database entry  found during PDB's search is compared to that provided by the depositor and any  differences are resolved or annotated.

All polymers in the entry will  be assigned a DBREF record.

Relationships to Other Record Types


DBREF represents the sequence as  found in SEQRES records.

DBREF1/DBREF2 replaces DBREF  when the accession codes or sequence numbering does not fit the DBREF format.

SEQADV

Overview

The SEQADV record identifies differences  between sequence information in the SEQRES records of the PDB entry and the  sequence database entry given in DBREF.  Please  note that these records were designed to identify differences and not errors.  No assumption is made as to which database  contains the correct data.  A comment  explaining any engineered differences in the sequence between the PDB and the  sequence database may also be included here.

50 - 70        LString       conflict      Conflict comment.

Details


In a number of cases,  conflicts between the sequences found in PDB entries and in sequence database  reference entries have been noted. There are several possible reasons for these  conflicts, including natural variants or engineered sequences (mutants),  polymorphic sequences, or ambiguous or conflicting experimental results. These  discrepancies are reported in SEQADV. Additional details may be included in  remark 999.

When conflicts arise which are  not classifiable by these terms, a reference to either a published paper, a PDB  entry, or a REMARK within the entry is given.

The comment "SEE REMARK  999" is included when the explanation for the conflict is too long to fit  the SEQADV record.

Some of the possible conflict  comments:

- Cloning artifact
- Expression tag
- Conflict
- Engineered
- Variant  
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Microheterogeneity
- Chromophore

Microheterogeneity is to be represented as a variant with one of the possible residues in the site being selected (arbitrarily) as the primary residue. The residues which do not match to the UNP reference will be listed in SEQADV records with the explanation of “microheterogeneity”.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


SEQADV records are automatically  generated.

Relationships to Other Record Types


SEQADV refers to the sequence as  found in the SEQRES records, and to the sequence database
reference found on DBREF.

REMARK 999 contains text that  explains discrepancies when the explanation is too lengthy to fit in SEQADV.

SEQRES

Overview

SEQRES records contain a  listing of the consecutive chemical components covalently linked in a linear  fashion to form a polymer. The chemical components included in this listing may  be standard or modified amino acid and nucleic acid residues. It may also  include other residues that are linked to the standard backbone in the polymer.  Chemical components or groups covalently linked to side-chains (in peptides) or  sugars and/or bases (in nucleic acid polymers) will not be listed here.

Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


The residues presented in the  ATOM records must agree with those on the SEQRES records.

The SEQRES records are checked using sequence databases and information  provided by the depositor.

SEQRES is compared to the ATOM  records during processing, and both are checked against the sequence databases.  All discrepancies are either resolved or annotated appropriately in the entry.

The ribo- and  deoxyribonucleotides in the SEQRES records are distinguished.  The ribo- forms of these residues are identified  with the residue names A, C, G, U and I. The deoxy- forms of these residues are  identified with the residue names DA, DC, DG, DT and DI. Modified nucleotides  in the sequence are identified by separate 3-letter residue codes.  The
plus
character prefix to label modified nucleotides (e.g. +A, +C, +T) is no longer  used.

Known Problems


Polysaccharides do not lend  themselves to being represented in SEQRES.

There is no mechanism provided  to describe the sequence order if their starting position is unknown.

For cyclic peptides, a residue  is arbitrarily assigned as the N-terminus.


MODRES

Overview

The MODRES record provides  descriptions of modifications (e.g., chemical or post-translational) to protein  and nucleic acid residues. Included are correlations between residue names  given in a PDB entry and standard residues.

Record Format

COLUMNS        DATA TYPE     FIELD       DEFINITION

 8 - 11        IDcode        idCode      ID code of this entry.
13 - 15        Residue name  resName     Residue name used in this entry.
17             Character     chainID     Chain identifier.

25 - 27        Residue name  stdRes      Standard residue name.
30 - 70        String        comment     Description of the residue modification.

Details


Residues modified  post-translationally, enzymatically, or by design are described in MODRES  records. In those cases where the wwPDB has opted to use a non-standard residue  name for the residue, MODRES also correlates the new name to the precursor  standard residue name.

Modified  nucleotides in the sequence are now identified by separate 3-letter residue  codes.  The
plus
character prefix to label modified nucleotides (e.g. +A, +C,  +T) is no longer used.

MODRES is mandatory when  modified standard residues exist in the entry. Examples of some modification  descriptions:

- Glycosylation site
- Post-translational modification
- Designed chemical modification
- Phosphorylation site
- D-configuration

A MODRES record is not  required if coordinate records are not provided for the modified residue.

D-amino acids are given their  own residue name (resName), i.e., DAL for D-alanine. This resName appears in  the SEQRES records, and has the associated MODRES, HET, and FORMUL records. The  coordinates are given as HETATMs within the ATOM records and occur in the  correct order within the chain. This ordering is an exception to the stated  Order of Records.

When a standard residue name  is used to describe a modified site, resName (columns 13-15) and stdRES  (columns 25-27) contain the same value.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


MODRES is generated by the  wwPDB.

Relationships to Other Record Types


MODRES maps ATOM and HETATM  records to the standard residue names. HET, and FORMUL may also appear.

)


HET

HET records are used to  describe non-standard residues, such as prosthetic groups, inhibitors, solvent  molecules, and ions for which coordinates are supplied. Groups are considered  HET if they are not part of a biological polymer described in SEQRES and  considered to be a molecule bound to the polymer, or they are a chemical  species that constitute part of a biological polymer and is not one of the  following:


standard amino acids, or

standard nucleic acids (C, G, A, U, I, DC, DG, DA, DU, DT and DI), or

unknown amino acid (UNK) or nucleic acid (N) where UNK and N are used to indicate the unknown residue name.


HET records also describe  chemical components for which the chemical identity is unknown, in which case  the group is assigned the hetID UNL (Unknown Ligand).

The heterogen section of a PDB  formatted file contains the complete description of non-standard residues in  the entry.

31 - 70       String        text           Text describing Het group.

Details


Each HET group is assigned a  hetID of not more than three (3) alphanumeric characters. The sequence number,  chain identifier, insertion code, and number of coordinate records are given  for each occurrence of the HET group in the entry. The chemical name of the HET  group is given in the HETNAM record and synonyms for the chemical name are  given in the HETSYN records, see
ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers
.

There is a separate HET record  for each occurrence of the HET group in an entry.

A particular HET group is  represented in the PDB archive with a unique hetID.

PDB entries do not have HET  records for water molecules, deuterated water, or methanol (when used as  solvent).

Unknown atoms or ions will be  represented as UNX with the chemical formula X1.  Unknown ligands are UNL; unknown amino acids  are UNK.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


For each het group that appears  in the entry, the wwPDB checks that the corresponding HET, HETNAM, HETSYN,  FORMUL, HETATM, and CONECT records appear, if applicable. The HET record is  generated automatically using the Chemical Component Dictionary and information  from the HETATM records.

Each unique hetID represents a  unique molecule.

Relationships to Other Record Types


For each het group that appears  in the entry, there must be corresponding HET, HETNAM, HETSYN, FORMUL,HETATM,  and CONECT records. LINK records may also be created.

Details


Each hetID is assigned a  unique chemical name for the HETNAM record, see
ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers
.

Other names for the group are  given on HETSYN records.

PDB entries follow IUPAC/IUB  naming conventions to describe groups systematically.

The special character “~” is  used to indicate superscript in a heterogen name. For example: 
  N6 will be listed in  the HETNAM section as N~6~, with the ~ character indicating both the start 
  and end of the superscript in  the name, e.g.,

N-(BENZYLSULFONYL)SERYL-N~1~-{4-[AMINO(IMINO)METHYL]BENZYL}GLYCINAMIDE

Continuation of chemical names  onto subsequent records is allowed.

Only one HETNAM record is  included for a given hetID, even if the same hetID appears on more than one HET  record.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control

For each het group that appears  in the entry, the corresponding HET, HETNAM, FORMUL, HETATM, and CONECT records  must appear. The HETNAM record is generated automatically using the Chemical Component  Dictionary and information from HETATM records.

Details


The elements of the chemical formula are given in the order following Hill ordering. The order of elements depends on whether carbon is present or not. If carbon is present, the order should be: C, then H, then the other elements in alphabetical order of their symbol. If carbon is not present, the elements are listed purely in alphabetic order of their symbol. This is the 'Hill' system used by Chemical Abstracts.

The number of each atom type  present immediately follows its chemical symbol without an intervening blank  space. There will be no number indicated if there is only one atom for a  particular atom type.

Each set of SEQRES records and  each HET group is assigned a component number in an entry. These numbers are  assigned serially, beginning with 1 for the first set of SEQRES records. In  addition:

- If a HET group is presented on a SEQRES record its FORMUL is assigned 
  the component number of the chain in which it  appears.
- If the HET group occurs more than once  and is not presented on SEQRES 
  records, the component number of its first  occurrence is used.

All occurrences of the HET  group within a chain are grouped together with a multiplier. The remaining  occurrences are also grouped with a multiplier. The sum of the multipliers is  the number equaling the number of times that that HET group appears in the  entry.

A continuation field is  provided in the event that more space is needed for the formula. 
  Columns 17 - 18 are used in  order to maintain continuity with the existing format.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


For each het group that appears in the entry, the corresponding HET, HETNAM, FORMUL, HETATM, and CONECT records  must appear. The FORMUL record is generated automatically by PDB processing  programs using the het group template file and information from HETATM records. UNL, UNK and UNX will not be listed in FORMUL even though these het groups present in the coordinate section.

Details


The initial residue for a  strand is its N-terminus. Strand registration information is provided in  columns 39 - 70. Strands are listed starting with one edge of the sheet and  continuing to the spatially adjacent strand.

The sense in columns 39 - 40  indicates whether strand n is parallel (sense = 1) or anti-parallel (sense =  -1) to strand n-1. Sense is equal to zero (0) for the first strand of a sheet.

The registration (columns 42 -  70) of strand n to strand n-1 may be specified by one hydrogen bond between  each such pair of strands. This is done by providing the hydrogen bonding  between the current and previous strands. No register information should be  provided for the first strand.

Split strands, or strands with  two or more runs of residues from discontinuous parts of the amino acid  sequence, are explicitly listed. Detail description can be included in the  REMARK 700 .


Relationships to Other Record Types


If the entry contains bifurcated  sheets or beta-barrels, the relevant REMARK 700 records must be provided. See  the REMARK section for details.

Connectivity Annotation Section

The connectivity annotation  section allows the depositors to specify the existence and location of  disulfide bonds and other linkages.


SSBOND

The SSBOND record identifies  each disulfide bond in protein and polypeptide structures by identifying the  two residues involved in the bond.

The  disulfide bond distance is included after the symmetry operations at the end of  the SSBOND record.

Details


Bond distances between the  sulfur atoms must be close to expected value.

sym1 and sym2 are right justified and are always given even when identity operator (no cell translation) is to be applied to the residue.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


wwPDB processing programs  generate these records automatically.

Relationships to Other Record Types


CONECT records are generated for  the disulfide bonds when SG atoms of both cysteines are present in the  coordinate records.

Known Problems


If SG of cysteine is disordered  then there are possible alternate linkages. wwPDB practice is to put together  all possible SSBOND records. This is problematic because the alternate location  identifier is not specified in the SSBOND record.


LINK

Overview

The LINK records specify connectivity  between residues that is not implied by the primary structure. Connectivity is  expressed in terms of the atom names. They also include the distance  associated with the each linkage following the symmetry operations at the end  of each record.

This record supplements information  given in CONECT records and is provided here for convenience in searching.

74 – 78         Real(5.2)      Length          Link distance

Details


The atoms involved in bonds  between HET groups or between a HET group and standard residue are listed.

Inter-residue linkages not  implied by the primary structure are listed (e.g., reduced peptide bond).

Non-standard linkages between  residues, e.g., side-chain to side-chain, are listed.

Each LINK record specifies one  linkage.

These records do not specify  connectivity within a HET group (see CONECT) or disulfide bridges (see SSBOND).

sym1 and sym2 are right  justified and are given as blank when the identity operator (and no cell  translation) is to be applied to the atom.

- For NMR entries, only one set (or model) of LINK records will be supplied. 
- Coordinate bonds are also listed as LINKs


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


The distance between the pair of  atoms listed must be consistent with the bonding.

Relationships to Other Record Types


CONECT records are generated  from LINKs when both atoms are present in the entry. If symmetry operators are  given to generate one of the residues involved in the bond, REMARK 290 defines  the symmetry transformation.

Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


These records are generated  automatically.

Relationships to Other Record Types


Peptide bonds which deviate  significantly from either the
cis
or
trans
conformation are annotated in  REMARK 500.

Details


The sequence number (columns 8  - 10) is reset to 1 for each new site.

SITE identifiers (columns 12 -  14) should be fully explained in remark 800.

If a site is composed of more  than four residues, these may be specified on additional records bearing the  same site identifier.

SITE records can include HET groups.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


Every SITE must have a  corresponding description in remark 800. The numbering of sequential SITE  records and format of each one is verified, as well as the existence of each  residue in the ATOM records.

Relationships to Other Record Types


Each listed SITE needs a  corresponding REMARK 800 that details its significance.

CRYST1

Overview

The CRYST1 record presents the  unit cell parameters, space group, and Z value. If the structure was not  determined by crystallographic means, CRYST1 simply provides the unitary  values, with an appropriate REMARK.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE    FIELD          DEFINITION
-------------------------------------------------------------

67 - 70       Integer       z              Z value.

Details


If the entry describes a  structure determined by a technique other than X-ray crystallography, CRYST1  contains a = b = c = 1.0, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees, space group = P 1,  and Z = 1.

The Hermann-Mauguin space  group symbol is given without parenthesis, e.g., P 43 21 2. Please note that  the screw axis is described as a two digit number.

The full International Table’s  Hermann-Mauguin symbol is used, e.g., P 1 21 1 instead of P 21.

For a rhombohedral space group  in the hexagonal setting, the lattice type symbol used is H.

The Z value is the number of  polymeric chains in a unit cell. In the case of heteropolymers, Z is the number  of occurrences of the most populous chain.


As an example, given two chains  A and B, each with a different sequence, and the space group P 2 that has two  equipoints in the standard unit cell, the following table gives the correct Z  value.

In the case of a  polycrystalline fiber diffraction study, CRYST1 and SCALE contain the normal  unit cell data.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


The given space group and Z  values are checked during processing for correctness and internal consistency.  The calculated SCALE factor is compared to that supplied by the depositor.  Packing is also computed, and close contacts of symmetry-related molecules are  diagnosed.

Relationships to Other Record Types

The unit cell parameters are  used to calculate SCALE. If the EXPDTA record is NMR, Electron microscopy, or Fiber  Diffraction, the CRYST1 record is predefined as in the last example (see below).  In these cases, an explanatory REMARK must also appear in the entry. Some fiber  diffraction structures will be done this way, while others will have a CRYST1  record containing measured values.

ORIGXn

Overview

The ORIGXn (n = 1, 2, or 3)  records present the transformation from the orthogonal coordinates contained in  the entry to the submitted coordinates.

46 - 55         Real(10.5)    t[n]          Tn

Details


This information is included  in the file even if the transformation is an identity transformation (unitary  matrix, null translation vector). See the SCALE section of this document for a  definition of the default orthogonal Angstroms system.

If the original submitted  coordinates are Xsub, Ysub, Zsub and the orthogonal Angstroms coordinates  contained in the data entry are X, Y, Z, then:


Xsub = O11X +  O12Y + O13Z + T1
        Ysub = O21X +  O22Y + O23Z + T2
        Zsub = O31X +  O32Y + O33Z + T3

Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


If the coordinates are submitted  in the same orthogonal Angstrom coordinate frame as they appear in the entry  (the usual case), then ORIGX is an identity matrix with a null translation vector. 
  If the transformation is not an  identity matrix with a null translation vector, then applying this  transformation to the coordinates in the entry yields the coordinates of the original deposited file.

Relationships to Other Record Types


ORIGX relates the coordinates in  the ATOM and HETATM records to the coordinates in the file.

SCALEn

Overview

The SCALEn (n = 1, 2, or 3)  records present the transformation from the orthogonal coordinates as contained  in the entry to fractional crystallographic coordinates. Non-standard  coordinate systems should be explained in the remarks.

Details


The standard orthogonal  Angstroms coordinate system used is related to the axial system of the unit  cell supplied (CRYST1 record) by the following definition:


If vector a, vector b, vector c  describe the crystallographic cell edges, and vector A, vector B, vector C are  unit cell vectors in the default orthogonal Angstroms system, then vector A,  vector B, vector C and vector a, vector b, vector c have the same origin;  vector A is parallel to vector a, vector B is parallel to vector C times vector  A, and vector C is parallel to vector a times vector b (i.e., vector c*). * If  the orthogonal Angstroms coordinates are X, Y, Z, and the fractional cell  coordinates are xfrac, yfrac, zfrac, then:

xfrac =  S11X + S12Y + S13Z + U1
            yfrac =  S21X + S22Y + S23Z + U2
            zfrac =  S31X + S32Y + S33Z + U3


For NMR, fiber diffraction, and  EM entries, SCALE is given as an identity matrix with no translation.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


The inverse of the determinant  of the SCALE matrix equals the volume of the cell. This volume is calculated  and compared to the SCALE matrix supplied by the depositor.

Relationships to Other Record Types

The SCALE transformation is  related to the CRYST1 record, as the inverse of the determinant of the SCALE  matrix equals the cell volume.

MTRIXn

Overview

The MTRIXn (n = 1, 2, or 3)  records present transformations expressing non-crystallographic symmetry.  MTRIXn will appear only when such  transformations are required to generate an entire asymmetric unit, such as a  large viral structure.

                                           contained in the entry. Otherwise, blank.

Details


The MTRIX transformations  operate on the coordinates in the entry to yield equivalent representations of  the molecule in the same coordinate frame. One trio of MTRIX records with a  constant serial number is given for each non-crystallographic symmetry  operation defined. If coordinates for the representations which are  approximately related by the given transformation are present in the file, the last  “iGiven” field is set to 1. Otherwise, this field is blank.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


All MTRIX records are verified  using records from the author and review.

Relationships to Other Record Types


None.

Coordinate Section

The Coordinate Section contains  the collection of atomic coordinates as well as the MODEL and ENDMDL  records.


MODEL

Overview

The MODEL record specifies the  model serial number when multiple models of the same structure are presented in  a single coordinate entry, as is often the case with structures determined by  NMR.

Record Format

COLUMNS        DATA  TYPE    FIELD          DEFINITION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6        Record name   "MODEL "
11 - 14        Integer       serial         Model serial number.

Details


This record is used only when more than one model appears in an entry. Generally, it is employed mainly for NMR structures. The chemical connectivity should be the same for each model. ATOM, HETATM, ANISOU, and TER records for each model structure and are interspersed as needed between MODEL and ENDMDL records.

The numbering of models is sequential, beginning with 1.

All models in a deposition should be superimposed in an appropriate author determined manner and only one superposition method should be used. Structures from different experiments, or different domains of a structure should not be superimposed and deposited as models of a deposition.

All models in an NMR ensemble should be homogeneous – each model should have the exact same atoms (hydrogen and heavy atoms), sequence and chemistry.

All models in an NMR entry should have hydrogen atoms.

Deposition of minimized average structure must be accompanied with ensemble and must be homogeneous with ensemble.

A model cannot have more than 99,999 atoms. Where the entry does not contain an ensemble of models, then the entry cannot have more than 99,999 atoms. Entries that go beyond this atom limit must be split into multiple entries, each containing no more than the limits specified above.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


Entries with multiple models in  the NUMMDL record are checked for corresponding pairs of MODEL/ ENDMDL records,  and for consecutively numbered models.

Relationships to Other Record Types


Each MODEL must have a  corresponding ENDMDL record.

ATOM

Overview

The ATOM records present  the atomic coordinates for standard amino acids and nucleotides. They also  present the occupancy and temperature factor for each atom. Non-polymer  chemical coordinates use the HETATM record type. The element symbol is always  present on each ATOM record; charge is optional.

Changes in ATOM/HETATM records result from the standardization atom and residue nomenclature.  This nomenclature is described in the Chemical Component Dictionary (
ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers
).

Details


ATOM records for proteins are  listed from amino to carboxyl terminus.

Nucleic acid residues are  listed from the 5' to the 3' terminus.

Alignment of one-letter atom name such as C starts at column 14, while two-letter atom name such as FE starts at column 13.

Atom nomenclature begins with atom type.

No ordering is specified for  polysaccharides.

Non-blank alphanumerical character is used for chain identifier.

The list of ATOM records in a  chain is terminated by a TER record.

If more than one model is  present in the entry, each model is delimited by MODEL and ENDMDL records.

AltLoc is the place holder to indicate alternate conformation. The alternate conformation can be in the entire polymer chain, or several residues or partial residue (several atoms within one residue). If an atom is provided in more than one position, then a non-blank alternate location indicator must be used for each of the atomic positions. Within a residue, all atoms that are associated with each other in a given conformation are assigned the same alternate position indicator. There are two ways of representing alternate conformation- either at atom level or at residue level (see examples).

For atoms that are in alternate sites indicated by the alternate site  indicator, sorting of  atoms in the ATOM/HETATM list uses the following general rules:

- In the simple case that involves a few  atoms or a few residues with alternate sites, 
  the coordinates occur one after  the other in the entry.
- In the case of a large heterogen groups  which are disordered, the atoms for each conformer 
  are listed together.

Alphabet letters are commonly used for insertion code. The insertion code is used when two residues have the same numbering. The combination of residue numbering and insertion code defines the unique residue.

If the depositor provides the data, then the isotropic B value is given  for the temperature factor.

If there are neither isotropic  B values from the depositor, nor anisotropic temperature factors in ANISOU,  then the default value of 0.0 is used for the temperature factor.

Columns 79 - 80 indicate any  charge on the atom, e.g., 2+, 1-. In most cases, these are blank.

For refinements with program REFMAC prior 5.5.0042 which use TLS refinement, the values of B may include only the TLS contribution to the isotropic temperature factor rather than the full isotropic value.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


The ATOM/HETATM records are  checked for PDB file format, sequence information, and packing.

Relationships to Other Record Types

The ATOM records are compared to  the corresponding sequence database. Sequence discrepancies appear in the  SEQADV record. Missing atoms are annotated in the remarks. HETATM records are  formatted in the same way as ATOM records. The sequence implied by ATOM records  must be identical to that given in SEQRES, with the exception that residues  that have no coordinates, e.g., due to disorder, must appear in SEQRES.

Details


Columns 7 - 27 and 73 - 80 are  identical to the corresponding ATOM/HETATM record.

The anisotropic temperature  factors (columns 29 - 70) are scaled by a factor of 10**4 (Angstroms**2) and  are presented as integers.

The anisotropic temperature  factors are stored in the same coordinate frame as the atomic coordinate  records.

ANISOU values are listed only  if they have been provided by the depositor.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control

The depositor provides ANISOU  records, and the wwPDB verifies their format.

Relationships to Other Record Types


The anisotropic temperature  factors are related to the corresponding ATOM/HETATM isotropic temperature  factors as ,B(eq), as described in the ATOM and HETATM sections.

TER

Overview

The TER record indicates the end  of a list of ATOM/HETATM records for a chain.

Record Format

COLUMNS        DATA  TYPE    FIELD           DEFINITION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6        Record name   "TER   "
 7 - 11        Integer       serial          Serial number.
18 - 20        Residue name  resName         Residue name.
22             Character     chainID         Chain identifier.
23 - 26        Integer       resSeq          Residue sequence number.
27             AChar         iCode           Insertion code.

Details


Every chain of ATOM/HETATM  records presented on SEQRES records is terminated with a TER record.

The TER records occur in the  coordinate section of the entry, and indicate the last residue presented for  each polypeptide and/or nucleic acid chain for which there are determined coordinates.  For proteins, the residue defined on the TER record is the carboxy-terminal  residue; for nucleic acids it is the 3'-terminal residue.

For a cyclic molecule, the  choice of termini is arbitrary.

Terminal oxygen atoms are  presented as OXT for proteins, and as O5’ or OP3 for nucleic acids. These atoms  are present only if the last residue in the polymer is truly the last residue  in the SEQRES.

The TER record has the same  residue name, chain identifier, sequence number and insertion code as the  terminal residue. The serial number of the TER record is one number greater  than the serial number of the ATOM/HETATM preceding the TER.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


TER must appear at the terminal carboxyl  end or 3' end of a chain. For proteins, there is usually a terminal oxygen, labeled  OXT. The validation program checks for the occurrence of TER and OXT records.

Relationships to Other Record Types

The residue name appearing on  the TER record must be the same as the residue name of the immediately  preceding ATOM or non-water HETATM record.

HETATM

Overview

Non-polymer or other  “non-standard” chemical coordinates, such as water molecules or atoms  presented in HET groups use the HETATM record type. They also present the occupancy and temperature  factor for each atom. The ATOM records present the atomic coordinates for  standard residues. The element symbol is always present on each HETATM record;  charge is optional.

Changes in ATOM/HETATM  records will require standardization in atom and residue nomenclature. This nomenclature is described in the  Chemical Component Dictionary,
ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers
.

Details


The x, y, z coordinates are in  Angstrom units.

No ordering is specified for  polysaccharides.

See the HET section of this  document regarding naming of heterogens. See the  Chemical Component Dictionary for residue names, formulas, and  topology of the HET groups that have appeared so far in the PDB (see
ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers
).

If the depositor provides the  data, then the isotropic B value is given for the temperature factor.

If there are neither isotropic  B values provided by the depositor, nor anisotropic temperature factors in  ANISOU, then the default value of 0.0 is used for the temperature factor.

Insertion codes and element  naming are fully described in the ATOM section of this document.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control

Processing programs check  ATOM/HETATM records for PDB file format, sequence information, and packing.

Relationships to Other Record Types

HETATM records must have  corresponding HET, HETNAM, FORMUL and CONECT records, except for waters.

ENDMDL

Overview

The ENDMDL records are paired  with MODEL records to group individual structures found in a coordinate entry.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE     FIELD        DEFINITION
------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - 6         Record name   "ENDMDL"

Details


MODEL/ENDMDL records are used  only when more than one structure is presented in the entry, as is often the  case with NMR entries.

All the models in a  multi-model entry must represent the same structure.

Every MODEL record has an  associated ENDMDL record.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


Entries with multiple structures in the NUMMDL record are checked for corresponding pairs of MODEL/ ENDMDL records, and for consecutively numbered models.

Relationships to Other Record Types

There must be a corresponding MODEL record.

In the case of an NMR entry, the NUMMDL record states the number of model structures that are present in the individual entry.

CONECT




Connectivity Section

This section provides  information on atomic connectivity. LINK, SSBOND, and CISPEP are found in the  Connectivity Annotation section.


CONECT

Overview

The CONECT records specify  connectivity between atoms for which coordinates are supplied. The connectivity  is described using the atom serial number as shown in the entry. CONECT records  are mandatory for HET groups (excluding water) and for other bonds not  specified in the standard residue connectivity table. These records are  generated automatically.

Record Format

COLUMNS       DATA  TYPE      FIELD        DEFINITION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 -  6        Record name    "CONECT"
 7 - 11       Integer        serial       Atom  serial number
12 - 16        Integer        serial       Serial number of bonded atom
17 - 21        Integer        serial       Serial  number of bonded atom
22 - 26        Integer        serial       Serial number of bonded atom
27 - 31        Integer        serial       Serial number of bonded atom

Details


CONECT records are present  for:

- Intra-residue connectivity within  non-standard (HET) residues (excluding water).
- Inter-residue connectivity of HET  groups to standard groups (including water) or to other HET groups. 
- Disulfide bridges specified in the  SSBOND records have corresponding records.

No differentiation is made  between atoms with delocalized charges (excess negative or positive charge).

Atoms specified in the CONECT  records have the same numbers as given in the coordinate section.

All atoms connected to the  atom with serial number in columns 7 - 11 are listed in the remaining fields of  the record.

If more than four fields are  required for non-hydrogen and non-salt bridges, a second CONECT record with the  same atom serial number in columns 7 - 11 will be used.

These CONECT records occur in  increasing order of the atom serial numbers they carry in columns 7 - 11. The  target-atom serial numbers carried on these records also occur in increasing  order.

The connectivity list given  here is redundant in that each bond indicated is given twice, once with each of  the two atoms involved specified in columns 7 - 11.

For hydrogen bonds, when the  hydrogen atom is present in the coordinates, a CONECT record between the  hydrogen atom and its acceptor atom is generated.

For NMR entries, CONECT  records for one model are generated describing heterogen connectivity and others  for LINK records assuming that all models are homogeneous models.


Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control


Connectivity is checked for  unusual bond lengths.

Relationships to Other Record Types


CONECT records must be present  in an entry that contains either non-standard groups or disulfide bonds.

Known Problems


CONECT records involving atoms  for which the coordinates are not present in the entry (e.g., symmetry-generated)  are not given.

CONECT records involving atoms  for which the coordinates are missing due to disorder, are also not provided.

REMARKS

Overview

REMARK records present  experimental details, annotations, comments, and information not included in  other records. In a number of cases, REMARKs are used to expand the contents of  other record types. A new level of structure is being used for some REMARK  records. This is expected to facilitate searching and will assist in the  conversion to a relational database.

The very first line of every set  of REMARK records is used as a spacer to aid in reading.
